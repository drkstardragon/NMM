NMM Gameplay OPTIONS Readme

This folder contains separate mod folders.
The mods can allow you to customise your NMM experience depending on your game style.
To use any of them, copy directly into the Mods folder.
They will activate as you launch the game.
Simply remove them from the Mods folder to deactivate them if they are no longer appropriate.

A) 1-NMMCore Food Spoilage
This mod activates food spoilage for NMM.
This allows any food you have (except for fish and honeycomb) to degrade over time. 

B) 1-NMMCore No Fire
This mod turns off all fire features for NMM.
This means entities and selective ammo cannot burn wooden buildings, etc.

C) 1-NMMCore No Fungus Fire
This mod turns off the fire feature for the 3 Fungus entities.
This means the acid vomit and globules cannot burn wooden buildings, etc.
All other fire features will remain active, such as Fire Breathing Dragon attacks.
