Natural Water Source:
	A water source is any BlockLiquidV2, such as water from a bucket, a POI water block, or any other direct water source in the world.

BlockWaterSourceSDX:
	This block can act like a water source block, if it's connected through a series of BlockWaterPipeSDX blocks. It has the same range and features of a natural water source.
	Think of this block as a sprinkler or water distributor.

BlockWaterPipeSDX:
	This block allows water to be read over distance if they are all connected together.
