/// treats setting any cvar value to zero as removing the cvar. This can happen if the faction
/// relationship is initially "Hate," or is reduced to zero later. The cvar will be set again if
/// the relationship becomes anything other than zero. Trying to read the value of a non-existent
/// cvar will result in a value of zero anyway, so this should not affect any uses of the cvar.
