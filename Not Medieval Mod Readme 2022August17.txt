====================================================================
== Not Medieval Mod for 7D2D is powered by 0-XNPCCore and 0-Score ==
====================================================================

This mod takes you back to somewhere around the Medieval times, give or take 500 years. ^^
It was conceived by Darkstardragon, and brings together a multitude of community creations.

You will be faced with a very special kind of 'Undead', a variety of 'Orc' types, 'Mystical Beasts', and human 'Locals'.
An abundance of Vanilla features remain, but in different form to roll back the time.

The Compo Pack is a well know and very well establish 7D2D resource that allows custom POIs/Prefabs to be added to Worlds.
Submissions are made to the CP team and kept as intact as possible beyond carefully modifying for quality and performance.
The beauty of the CP is that it is very welcoming and open to all submissions and supports over 1000 Prefabs.
A20 further diversified Worlds with a Tiling system and Stallionsden and team have carefully created themed tiles.

Check them out here:

The Medievil Village is one of the themed tile sets and consists of 31 community made Prefabs that have been updated or submitted for A20.
All of the Prefabs keep their original names. However, the Sleeper Volumes, some internal assets, and tags have been changed to match the theme

============
INSTALLATION
============
For Players and Server Admin/Hosts who have never installed a mod before, here are some simple step by step instructions:

1. If you've never installed a mod before, it is necessary to create a Mods folder in the main directory, typically inside
\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die. In the future, this location may change and we'll update instructions at that time.
If you have a custom install or your server host has modified the installation location, then you may have to explore.

2. Simply make a new folder called Mods (with a capital M to reflect standard nomenclature) in your '7 Days To Die' main directory folder.

3. You can now drag all of the mod folders directly out of the zipped file, and it can be placed directly into the Mods folder.
It should look like the list of folders and file in the image on the introductory post for this mod on the 7 Days forum.

Does this Mod need to be installed in the server/client host? = YES
Do players also need to install this Mod? = YES (because it contains custom content that cannot be downloaded from the server).
